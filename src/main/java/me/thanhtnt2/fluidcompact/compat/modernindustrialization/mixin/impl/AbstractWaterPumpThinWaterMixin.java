/**
 * Lets the water pump see the thin, non-source water layers Flowing Fluids leaves behind.
 *
 * <p>Modern Industrialization counts only source blocks around the pump, so a pond that has been drained down
 * to thin layers would keep the pump running without ever giving water again. Counting such a layer as one
 * water cell makes the pump finish the pond. The water is still paid by the world in {@code MiPumpBridge},
 * so the pump can never give more than the world holds.
 *
 * <p>Kept apart from the main pump mixin on purpose: both injectors use {@code require = 0}, so if Modern
 * Industrialization ever changes this method, only this feature switches itself off and the hook that stops
 * the pump from creating water stays active.
