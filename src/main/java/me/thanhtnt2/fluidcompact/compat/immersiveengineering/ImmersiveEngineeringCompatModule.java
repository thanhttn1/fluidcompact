/**
 * Immersive Engineering. Only the Fluid Pump takes fluid out of the world. With Flowing Fluids it is stopped from
 * making endless water, empties a pond completely including its thin layers, and no longer leaves cobblestone behind.
 * The Fluid Placer needs nothing, it puts down one source block per 1000 mB taken from its tank. The hooks are mixins
 * that are applied all together or not at all, depending on {@code guard.PumpContract}.
