/**
 * The decisions behind the Immersive Engineering Fluid Pump hooks.
 *
 * <p><b>Endless source.</b> The pump asks {@code FluidState.canConvertToSource} in two places. When the answer is
 * yes, it fills its tank for free from any source block that has two source neighbours (vanilla's "infinite water"
 * rule) and its area search skips that fluid completely. Flowing Fluids does not change that answer, so with the
 * gamerule on the pump would make water out of nothing. Answering "no" for finite fluids sends the pump down the
 * path it already uses for lava or oil: it takes real source blocks out of the world, 1000 mB per block, which keeps
 * the water count.
 *
 * <p><b>Cobblestone.</b> On that path the pump replaces each emptied block with cobblestone. For a finite fluid
 * that would leave stone where the pond should shrink, so the replacement is skipped and Flowing Fluids refills
 * the gap.
