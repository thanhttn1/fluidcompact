/**
 * Keeps the Fluid Pump from putting cobblestone where it emptied a block of a finite fluid.
 *
 * <p>After taking a block the pump replaces it with cobblestone, and by then the block is already air, so the fluid
 * can no longer be looked up. The fluid is therefore checked just before the pump takes the block, and the result is
 * kept until the cobblestone call that follows in the same tick. The pump also places cobblestone on a block that
 * turned out to be empty already (its work list is older than the water, which Flowing Fluids keeps moving), so the
 * fluid the pump is working on decides as well.
 *
 * <p>Separate from {@link FluidPumpBlockEntityMixin}: {@code ImmersiveEngineeringMixinPlugin} checks this one on its
 * own, so if Immersive Engineering changes this part of the pump only the cobblestone handling switches itself off.
